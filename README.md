Hi, I am Tommy Tran. I'm a third year ~~CS~~ ***Math-CS major***.

# This is **me**.

## Languages and Skills
- Python
- Html, CSS, Javascript
- C++

## What I want from this class
1. Get better as programming (obviously)
  - Html, CSS, Javascript specifically
2. Create a product
3. Add product to resume

## About me
I don't use *a lot* of social media but here's
my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tommy.traan/).

I'm **relatively _new_ to programming**, but here's a
[random pong game I made](./PongGame/static/index.html) as I learned a bit of
html, css, and javascript over break.

## What I wanted to learn over break
- [x] Html, CSS, Javascript
- [ ] React
- [ ] Express & Nodejs

but hopefully I learn the rest throughout the quarter.

A random quote I like is:
> "Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough."

I don't use git commands often but here are some basic Git commands I do use when needed:
```
git clone
git commit
```
